- Explanation:
<link>: This HTML element is used to define a relationship between the current document and an external resource.
rel="icon": The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource. In this case, it indicates that the linked resource is an icon.
href="***/favicon/***.png": The href attribute specifies the path to the favicon file. This can be a relative or absolute URL.

- Effect in Chrome:
In Chrome, you can see the effect of this line of code in several places:
Browser Tab: The favicon appears next to the page title in the browser tab.
Address Bar: The favicon is displayed in the address bar, next to the URL.
Bookmarks: When you bookmark the page, the favicon appears next to the bookmark title.
This small icon helps users quickly identify and differentiate between websites, especially when multiple tabs are open.
