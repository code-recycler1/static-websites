The text you need without any formatting:
```text
My student card is... 
A daily tool 
You can use the student card on all campuses to print, copy, and borrow in the library. In addition, there are many other uses, such as paying at the student restaurant on the Geel, Lier, Vorselaar, and Turnhout campuses, and access to buildings in Mechelen. 
A discount card  
As a student, you receive discounts both inside and outside the school on various purchases and activities. 
Broken? Lost?  
The student card is an electronic card. Therefore, handle it carefully and avoid damage or misuse. If your student card is not working or you lose it,  
go to the student administration on your campus. You will pay 4 euros for a new card.
```

‘**My student card is…**’ is the main title of the webpage,  
‘**A daily tool**’, ‘**A discount card**’, and ‘**Broken? Lost?**’ are level 2 headings.  
The word ‘**Geel**’ is emphasized (strong), and the number ‘*4*’ is emphasized (em).
