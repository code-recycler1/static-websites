	<h1>My student card is...</h1>
	<h2>A daily tool</h2>
	<p>
		You can use the student card on all campuses to print, copy, and borrow in the library. In addition, there are
		many other uses, such as paying at the student restaurant on the <strong>Geel</strong>, Lier, Vorselaar, and
		Turnhout campuses,
		and access to buildings in Mechelen.
	</p>
	<h2>A discount card</h2>
	<p>
		As a student, you receive discounts both inside and outside the school on various purchases and activities.
	</p>
	<h2>Broken? Lost?</h2>
	<p>
		The student card is an electronic card. Therefore, handle it carefully and avoid damage or misuse. If your
		student card is not working or you lose it, go to the student administration on your campus. You will pay
		<em>4</em> euros for a new card.
