    <h1>Information Days</h1>
    <h2>A smooth start at Thomas More!</h2>

    <p>At Thomas More, you start your first academic year with '<em>welcome days</em>'. On these days, we serve a
        <strong>perfect</strong> combination of <strong>cozy</strong> relaxation activities and
        <strong>interesting</strong> info sessions. These info sessions are a must, they are part of your training
        program. This way, you get to know your fellow students, your campus, and your course even before you have had a
        single lesson.
