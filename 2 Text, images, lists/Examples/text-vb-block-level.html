    <h1>Information Days</h1>
    <h2>A smooth start at Thomas More!</h2>

    <p>At Thomas More, you start your first academic year with 'welcome days'. On these days, we serve a perfect
        combination of cozy relaxation activities and interesting info sessions.
        <!-- This whitespace is not visible online! -->
        These info sessions are a must, they are part of your training program. This way, you get to know your fellow
        students, your campus, and your course even before you have had a single lesson.
    </p>
