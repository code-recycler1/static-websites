	Applied Computer Science

	Every organization relies on IT, and you can find opportunities everywhere. As an IT specialist, you are the link
	between people with digital questions and machines with digital solutions. What makes our program unique is that we
	teach you to handle both, with machines and with people.

	Are you not afraid of challenges, interested in the latest information technology (IT), and enjoy working with
	people? Then we will prepare you in a practical way to become a real IT specialist.

	Best program

	In 2011, the Flemish Council of Universities and Colleges chose our program as the best in Flanders for Applied
	Computer Science due to four special features:

	We have an excellent approach because we do not think solely in terms of subjects, but let your acquired knowledge
	and skills flow together in projects. You truly learn by doing. We not only provide you with technical knowledge,
	but we also pay a lot of attention to your professional development and communication skills. We do this tailored to
	you and excellently! Companies from the IT sector support us to keep our well-structured program up to date and
	field-oriented. Those who want to work or study abroad for a semester get that opportunity thanks to our
	international partners. Are you the motivated IT specialist the field is waiting for?
