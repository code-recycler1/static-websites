**Additional clarifications:**  
- The title **"Webcourse HTML"** is a level 1 heading.  
- The line under the title spans the full width of the browser window.  
- The table border is 6 pixels wide.  
- The space between the cells is 0.  
- The padding around the text in the cells is 6 pixels.  
- Don’t forget the table caption!  

5. Validate your solution via [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). There should be no error messages or warnings.  


## Exercise 2

1. Copy the starter file `exercise_x.html` and rename it to `exercise_2.html`.  
2. Open this file in Visual Studio Code.  
3. Set an appropriate page title and fill in the meta tag "Author".  
4. Recreate the following page with a table as closely as possible:  

![Exercise 2 Image 1](./Screenshots/Exercise_2-1.png)  

**Additional clarifications:**  
- Assign the following attributes to the table (we will later handle this via CSS):  
  - Border around the table: 1 pixel.  
  - Space between cells: 0 pixels.  
  - Padding between text in cells and the cell border: 0 pixels.  
- Ensure that column 1 has a background color of `#009cab` and a width of 75 pixels. Solve this using `colgroup` and `col`.  
- The first row has a background color of `#dd3434`.  

5. Validate your solution via [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). You should have no errors or warnings, except for:  
   *"The xxx attribute on the TABLE element is obsolete".*  
   This will be resolved later using CSS.

2. Open this file in Visual Studio Code.  
3. Set an appropriate page title and fill in the meta tag "Author".  
4. Recreate the following page with a table as closely as possible:

- Border around the table: 3 pixels wide.  
- Space between the cells: 4 pixels.  
- Padding between text in cells and the cell border: 1 pixel.

5. Validate your solution via [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). You should have no errors or warnings, except for:  
   *"The xxx attribute on the TABLE element is obsolete".*  
   This will be resolved later using CSS.
