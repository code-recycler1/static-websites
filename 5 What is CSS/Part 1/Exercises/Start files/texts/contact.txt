Jan Dupré offers performance prices that make it possible for everyone to host a party on location. Since not every party is the same, there are no fixed prices; instead, the price is adjusted according to the customer's wishes.

Nevertheless, the basic package remains a 5-hour package starting from 8 PM to 1 AM.

Important factors in calculating the total price include the amount of sound and lighting equipment needed to set up a party (depending on the number of people and the size of the location), the duration of the party, and the day on which the event takes place.

If audio and lighting equipment is provided on-site, a fixed price is agreed upon since only presentation and music are provided.

This can be arranged on an hourly basis with a minimum package of 5 hours.
