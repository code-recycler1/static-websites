Why Pay Attention to Sound/Light?

At an on-location disco, a light show is essential. Besides the right music, a proper lighting setup creates atmosphere and coziness. Light enhances the experience of the music and is inseparably linked to the disco.

Jan Dupré provides a comprehensive and customized lighting setup at every party, adding extra dance-friendly ambiance to your party location. Lighting is adjusted to the available space and possibilities.

If you have special additional requests or the standard light show is not sufficient, Jan Dupré can expand the lighting setup to the desired size. We have a large assortment of lights, ensuring we always have more than enough equipment. (no rental)
