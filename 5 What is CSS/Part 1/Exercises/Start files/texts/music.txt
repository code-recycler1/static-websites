Good Partying?

A party is not a party without good music at the right moment. Whether it's music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, Dance, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Dutch-language, or the hits of tomorrow, everything is available.

The DJing is done under the motto: "Not too much talk, but music," which means I don't constantly talk over the music but keep the rhythm going by playing as much music as possible.

Presentation Of course, if a presentation is needed, it will be done according to the project's wishes and needs, and very polished language will be used.

A repertoire is always adjusted to the audience. Requests on the evening itself are no problem, and it is possible to provide a list of preferred music in advance so that you are sure that one hit will turn the dance floor upside down.

Arrangements Well before your party takes place, we will meet to go through the evening together and finalize the details.
