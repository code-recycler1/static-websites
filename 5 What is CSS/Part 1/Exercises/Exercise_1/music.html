                    A party is not a party without good music at the right moment.
                </strong><br />
                Whether it's music from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, Dance, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Dutch-language, or the hits
                of tomorrow, everything is available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The DJing is done under the motto:</strong><br />
                "Not too much talk, but music," which means I don't constantly talk over the music but keep the rhythm
                going by playing as much music as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Presentation</strong><br />
                Of course, if a presentation is needed, it will be done according to the project's wishes and needs, and
                very polished language will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A repertoire is always adjusted to the audience. </strong><br />
                Requests on the evening itself are no problem, and it is possible to provide a list of preferred music
                in advance so that you are sure that one hit will turn the dance floor upside down.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Arrangements</strong><br />
                Well before your party takes place, we will meet to go through the evening together and finalize the
                details.
