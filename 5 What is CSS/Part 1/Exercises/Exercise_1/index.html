                <strong>Best of the best</strong><br />
                When free radio stations were at their peak in terms of listenership and popularity in the late 80s and
                early 90s, Jan Dupré was one of the pioneers who was already very interested in this medium from the
                beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Best practices</strong><br />
                After taking diction lessons, he could be heard daily on one of the many stations that Antwerp was (and
                is) rich in.<br />
                Starting at Antigoon and subsequently, European University Radio, SIS, Contact, Micron FM, Studio Mega,
                Bavo Radio, Metropolis, and finally Nostalgie, he has covered the entire spectrum of music styles under
                turntables, CD players, and finally PCs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Powerful integration</strong><br />
                In the context of this radio activity, he also started DJing weekly in various nightclubs, later
                becoming a resident in several clubs such as: Chapeau, Avant Garde, Kiosk, Biazar, Zottekot, Ozzy place,
                Theadrome (resident), etc.<br />
                As requests came in to DJ at private parties as well, Jan Dupré made several investments in equipment
                and lighting, allowing him to offer his services to anyone who has something to celebrate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Latest technologies and standards</strong><br />
                He never loses sight of the importance of using equipment that meets the highest standards in terms of
                quality, reliability, and robustness.<br />
                To everyone's satisfaction, Jan Dupré has grown into a well-known figure in this world, which is often
                taken over by one-hit wonders offering dubious quality equipment and talent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Party for today and tomorrow</strong><br />
                Whether you organize your party in a parish hall, canteen, auditorium, salon, at home, or in the garden,
                Jan Dupré ensures that sound and lighting are fully adapted to your party, creating a warm atmosphere
                that invites fun.<br />
                It is evident that a party, theme night, wedding, anniversary, or ball each requires a completely
                different approach, and experience largely determines whether your party will be a hit or not.<br />
                In short, if you want to dance the stars from the sky, your choice is quickly made.<br />
                For everything that needs to be fun... Jan Dupré.
